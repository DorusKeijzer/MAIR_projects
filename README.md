for assignment 1a, see the readme inside of `1a/`

for main program. install dependencies and run main.py:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

the program is still rough around the edges, i.e. it does not recommend a different restaurant if you ask for one (it just gives the same restaurant), but that functionality does exist in `assignment_1b/lookup_restaurant.py`. The algorithm to extract preferences is in `assignment_1b/extract_preferences.py`
